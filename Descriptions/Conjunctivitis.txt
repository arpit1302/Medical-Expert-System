Conjunctivitis, commonly known as “pink eye,” is an infection or swelling in the outer membrane of your eyeball. Blood vessels in your conjunctiva, a thin membrane that lines part of your eye, become inflamed. This gives your eye the red or pink color that's commonly associated with conjunctivitis.
